# reactComponentScript

just a simple PowerShell script that can allow you to create a named directory with a linked css file and js file with boilerplate code for a React function component inside of it! 

This should help speed up development for the more tedious aspects of creating a react app!

Use as you please! 

Enjoy! :)
